When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you want to share your work, or put ti someplace safe.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	So you don't get changes that could interfere with code that you are working on.
	

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork is a clone on GitHub
	Clone makes a copy of a repository
	Branch is a new branch in an existing repository
	
	Fork makes it easy to share stuff on GitHub
	Clone copies repositories to different places, so they can be modified separately
	Branch to make changes that you want to be isolated.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	You can can do diffs and merges of the remote change, conveniently on the local machine.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	
	Without, share files. Email files to each other? Seeing changes would be more difficult. It would be easy to
	miss changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	My feeling is that you always make changes in a separate branch. Always using Master is simpler, but you quickly run 	into problems collaborating or managing release versions while working on new features.
