When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you want to share your work, or put ti someplace safe.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	So you don't get changes that could interfere with code that you are working on.
	

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork is a clone on GitHub
	Clone makes a copy of a repository
	Branch is a new branch in an existing repository
	
	Fork makes it easy to share stuff on GitHub
	Clone copies repositories to different places, so they can be modified separately
	Branch to make changes that you want to be isolated.
