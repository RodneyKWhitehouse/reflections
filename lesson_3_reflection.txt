When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you want to share your work, or put ti someplace safe.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	So you don't get changes that could interfere with code that you are working on.
