What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	You need to create a repository before you can put anything in it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It allows you a scratch pad to set everything up correctly before committing.
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	If you have multiple changes, you can only stage the file for one change at a time.
	
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	When you want to make changes or add new features while keeping the main branch clean for releases.
	
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	How else could you keep track of it in your head.
	
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

	We non-destructively make one branch out of the changes in two.
	
What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

	It handles the easy stuff for you and saves a lot of time. It also highlight conflicts
	which also saves time. It always saves you time, so I don't see a downside, unless it screws up.
