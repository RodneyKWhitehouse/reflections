What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	You need to create a repository before you can put anything in it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It allows you a scratch pad to set everything up correctly before committing.
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	If you have multiple changes, you can only stage the file for one change at a time.
